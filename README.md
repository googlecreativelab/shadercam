shadercam
=========

Simple OpenGL Shaders with the [camera2](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary.html) apis in Android 7.0+

examples
--------

Check out [`shadercam-example`](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/shadercam/tree/master/shadercam-example) here for basic usage.

Also, **shadercam** was built for usage with a couple Android Experiments:

* [Lip Swap](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/lipswap)
* [Tunnel Vision](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/tunnelvision)

**updated 10/31/18**

**shadercam** is now using [RecordableSurfaceView](https://github.com/UncorkedStudios/recordablesurfaceview) to draw to the screen as well as record video. This means some things have changed but compatibility across devices has improved. See below for a guide on upgrading. All previous classes and methods are still available, so the new API is non-breaking, but includes no fixes for pre-2.0 versions.

usage (as of release-2.0)
-----

Import **shadercam** in your `build.gradle` file:

```
implementation project(':shadercam')
```
or

In the project gradle add jitpack:

```
repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }

    }
```
And then in your app gradle, add the dependency for shadercam:

```
implementation 'com.github.googlecreativelab:shadercam:2.0.1'
```

Integration Example
-----
_**Changed from v1.0:** shadercam now expects that a VideoRenderer be created and attached before  connecting to the Camera preview service. This is more in line with OpenGL renderer lifecycle patterns_

**shadercam** comes with a simple implementation of the camera2 apis called `VideoFragment`, which only
requires that you add a `RecordableSurfaceView` to your layout.

```
    <com.uncorkedstudios.android.view.recordablesurfaceview.RecordableSurfaceView
        android:id="@+id/texture"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_alignParentTop="true" />
```

Then it is a fairly simple matter of configuring and attaching the Camera management fragment:

```
private void setupCameraFragment(VideoRenderer renderer) {

        mVideoFragment = VideoFragment.getInstance();
        mVideoFragment.setCameraToUse(VideoFragment.CAMERA_FORWARD);
        
        //pass in a reference to the RecordableSurfaceView - this is important
        mVideoFragment.setRecordableSurfaceView(mRecordableSurfaceView);

        //Connect your renderer
        mVideoFragment.setVideoRenderer(renderer);

        FragmentTransaction transaction = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
        transaction.add(mVideoFragment, TAG_CAMERA_FRAGMENT);
        transaction.commit();
    }
```
Once the VideoFragment has been provided a renderer (a default one is provided in the case where you do not provide a custom one), and a RecordableSurfaceView to render onto, it can then be added to the activity and brought to life for viewing the camera feed. 

In order to record to a video file, there are a few more steps to take.

For example, in this implementation of  onResume, we make sure that `RecordableSurfaceView` has a handle to a file that it has permissions to write a movie file to: 

```
public void onResume() {
   ...
               
    mRecordableSurfaceView.initRecorder(mCurrentVideoFile, size.x, size.y, null, null);
    
    ...
}
```

> Note that phones with Notches may behave differently based on the underlying system's implementation, for example, the outputs of [getRealSize](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Display#getRealSize(android.graphics.Point)) vs. [getSize](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Display#getSize(android.graphics.Point)) in the [Display](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Display) class will return different shapes that either include or exclude the notch. 


Lifecycle
----
The new `VideoRenderer` class implements `RecordableSurfaceView.RendererCallbacks` so your top-level renderer can recieve lifecycle callbacks like onSurfaceChanged and onDrawFrame - closer to the native [GLSurfaceView.Renderer](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/GLSurfaceView.Renderer) pattern.

> `public void onSurfaceCreated()`


> `public void onSurfaceChanged(int width, int height) `

etc. 

Examples:
----
Check out `MeetupActivityV2`, `SimpleRSVShaderActivity` and `ExampleVideoRenderer` in `shadercam-example` for some straightforward example code.
